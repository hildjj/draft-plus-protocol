Internet-Draft                plus-protocol                  August 2016


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a common minimal path layer protocol for UDP-
   encapsulated transport protocols with in order to provide minimal,
   transport- independent state exposure to support firewall and load
   balancer operation [EDITOR'S NOTE cite appropriate section of draft-
   kuehlewind-plus-ps once it exists].

1.1.  Requirements

   o  Hint to Initiator's network path that PLUS is likely in use

   o  Hint to Initiator's network path that Initiator wants to initiate
      a new connection

   o  Further indication to path that PLUS protocol is in use when
      Responder's messages are seen by the path, better than 5-tuple.

   o  Matching Responder's packets to Initiator's intent to communicate,
      better than 5-tuple

2.  Terminology

   o  Initiator: The active opener of a transport-layer association.  In
      a client- server protocol, this is generally the client.

   o  Responder: The listener (passive opener) of a transport-layer
      association.  In a client-server protocol, this is generally the
      server.

   o  Upper-layer transport: The transport protocol which uses PLUS for
      common signaling.

3.  Protocol Specification

   The PLUS protocol fits between the UDP header and the (encrypted)
   upper layer transport header and payload, adding eight bytes to each
   packet sent by the initiator, and four bytes to each packet sent by
   the responder.  The initiator's PLUS header allows the

   The following bits are defined:

   o  Magic: 32 bits.  Magic numbers should be chosen such that they do
      not appear as the first 32 bits of any widely deployed UDP-based
      protocol, to allow initiator packets to be probabilistically
      separated from reflected UDP traffic.  For the version of the PLUS
      protocol described in this document, the value of the Magic field
      is 0xd80000d8.

   o  Association Token: 24 bits.  A cryptographically random token
      chosen by the initiator for this association.

   o  R bit (Reset): The initiator sets this bit to indicate the
      association is closing.

   o  X bit (Reserved): Reserved for future use in this protocol.  Must
      be zero.

   o  tflags: 6 bits: available for use in the next layer

   The following bits are defined:

   o  hmac, 24 bits: HMAC_SHA256(magic, ConnectionID), truncated

   o  R, 1 bit: Reset

   o  X, 1bits: reserved for future use in this protocol

   o  tflags: 6 bits: available for use in the next layer

3.3.  Indication of implementation

   The receiver performs HMAC_256(0xd80000d8, ConnectionID), and uses
   the first 3 bytes as the first 3 bytes of the reply.  This is used as
   a further hint that the magic number use was intentional.  Call this
   function Indicator(ConnectionID).

   Usefully, none of these truncated HMACs return the magic number.

3.4.  Reset bit

   Set the Reset bit to tell the path that you're shutting down.  Work
   will need to be done on this section to define what actions the path
   will take; one possible approach is to shorten the association timer
   to a smaller, constant value.

   Upper-layer transports should consider providing security around this
   bit before trusting that it comes from the other endpoint.

4.  Processing

   Basic idea: Initiator sends bits defined in Section 3.1, Responder
   sends bits defined in Section 3.2.  Initiator always has to send
   first over every new path.

4.1.  Processing by applications

   o  If the RSV bit is set, ignore the packet

   o  Initiator: If the hmac doesn't match what you expect, it's either
      an attack or leftover traffic from a previous connection.  Maybe
      send an unsigned RST? (maybe this is a policy or transport-
      specific decision)

   o  Responder: If the magic number isn't there, it's likely an attack.
      Probably best to ignore it.

4.2.  Processing by path elements

   o  Assume that all bits are protected by next layer, so you can't
      change them.  Even if you could change them, you may as well just
      drop the packet, since delivery won't work.

   o  Don't think that having RSV set means this is an attack.  It's
      just something we haven't specified as of the time you wrote your
      code.

4.3.  From inside to outside:

   o  Match magic number

      *  If not, treat as non-PLUS UDP; use port for example

   o  Forward 6tuple = 5tuple + ConnectionID

   o  Reverse 6tuple = Reverse 5tuple + Indicator(ConnectionID)

   o  Look up Forward

      *  If not, create state keyed by Forward and Reverse

   o  Reset timer

      *  When timer fires, either drop state or send RST hint both ways
         without e2e crypto

   o  Allow

4.4.  From outside to inside:

   o  Look up Reverse, allow if match

      *  If not, treat as non-PLUS UDP

   (TODO: determine if reverse timer is useful)

5.  Guidelines for next layer

   New transport' protocols like QUIC.

   o  Define tflags as you see fit

   o  Consider if these bits need protection.  At least tflags do.

   o  Consider multipath consequences, send before you receive on each
      path, and consider using a different ConnectionID on different
      paths to make tracking harder.  If so, figure out how load
      balancers are going to deal with the problem.

6.  Security Considerations

   Next layer transport protocols SHOULD discuss whether any of these
   bits need to be protected.

   Discuss the actual number of bits that window tracking gives you for
   TCP.  Contrast this with how useful this would be for tracking
   people.

   ConnectionID's MUST NOT be under the control of untrusted code, like
   JavaScript.  It's likely there's a reason for making them not
   available to untrusted code as well.

7.  IANA Considerations

   Do we need a registry of magic numbers?
